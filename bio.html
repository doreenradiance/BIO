                  <h1>PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY</h1>
                  <p>DOREEN ANUM is my name. I'm 19 years of age.
                      I'm a young female trying to explore 
                      the world with the litte knowledge I've got from my creator.
                      I'm the second of three children.
                      I'm a cool person who fits into any situation I find myself.
                      I like and dislike everything.
                      I've lived in MATAHEKO-ACCRA since childhood.
                      But I have the dream of travelling all over the world to explore my GOD-given latent talent,
                      to work with people of my field and learn from them as well.
                      Mom left when it was three perfect days to my nineteenth birthday with the strength of my creator I'm
                      getting over it, but I have her in my everyday thoughts. I wanna make MAMA proud someday.

                      I am very good with handi-works, I try to create things on my own when there's the need to do so,
                      because of this I persued visual arts at my shs level.
                      I love to work at all time. I love to read any interesting thing I set my eyes on.
                      I don't wait for someone to instruct me about what to do,meaning I hate being instructed around.

                      My other dream is to make my family proud of me and love me as well.
                      I love to help those who are in need of my help. I don't waste my time on people who don't 
                      waste their time on me. I love those who love me and hate those who hate me.
                      I love to share what I have but only when I know its very beneficial.
                      People think I'm anti-social but thats not it, when you get closer you would know how sociable I am.
                      I feel quiet okay when I'm all on myself .I like thinking as well to know whats ahead of time and me.
                      I never look down upon others since no one knows what the future holds.

                      One other dream is to help the homeless,provide for those in prison and provide for the hospitals 
                      that are in need of anything involved with the hospital.(This is one of my dreams that I am passionate about
                      and really need the help of my creator to do so.)

                      I am now on my next goal as an shs graduate, learning on how to be a software designer.
                      I want to attain higher heights as I go on my daily activities,goals and other things all with the help of my 
                      creator. And I know with HIS help I will be successful in whatever plans I have for myself and others.
